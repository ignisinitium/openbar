      ${ client } is entitled to

      Four score and seven years ago
      our fathers brought forth on
      this continent, a new nation,
      conceived in Liberty, and
      dedicated to the proposition
      that all men are created equal.

      nation, or any nation so
      conceived and so dedicated,
      can long endure.
