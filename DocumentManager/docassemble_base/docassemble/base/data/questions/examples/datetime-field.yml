subquestion: |
  When inserted in into a question,
  `target_variable` looks like
  ${ target_variable }.

  But `target_variable` is also a
  special date/time object.

  For example, using the `.format_datetime()`
  method, the date/time can be expressed as
  ${ target_variable.format_datetime('h:mm in MMMM') }.

  Using the `.minus()` method, 24 hours
  before the date/time can be expressed as
  ${ target_variable.minus(hours=24) }.
