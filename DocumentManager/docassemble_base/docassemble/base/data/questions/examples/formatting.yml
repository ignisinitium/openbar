      [BOLDCENTER] A Test Document [BR]

      Four score and seven years ago
      our fathers brought forth on
      this continent, a new nation,
      conceived in Liberty, and
      dedicated to the proposition
      that all men are created equal.

      [FILE bluediamond.svg, 0.5in]

      Now we are engaged in a great
      civil war, testing whether that
      nation, or any nation so
      conceived and so dedicated,
      can long endure.

      [PAGEBREAK]

      Now we begin a new[EMDASH]and
      very exciting[EMDASH]page.

      We dare not forget today that
      we are the heirs of that first
      revolution. Let the word go
      forth from this time and place,
      to friend and foe alike, that
      the torch has been passed to
      a new generation of
      Americans [ENDASH] born in this
      century, tempered by war,
      disciplined by a hard and
      bitter peace, proud of our
      ancient heritage, and unwilling
      to witness or permit the slow
      undoing of those human rights
      to which this nation has
      always been committed, and to
      which we are committed today
      at home and around the world.

      And yet our distress comes from
      no failure of substance. We are
      stricken by no plague of locusts.
      Compared with the perils which
      our forefathers conquered,
      because they believed and were
      not afraid, we have still much
      to be thankful for. Nature still
      offers her bounty and human
      efforts have multiplied it.
      Plenty is at our doorstep, but
      a generous use of it languishes
      in the very sight of the supply.

      [NOINDENTATION]

      My Fellow Americans,

      [INDENTATION]

      I come before you tonight as a
      candidate for the Vice Presidency
      and as a man whose honesty
      and -- and integrity has been
      questioned.

      Now, the usual political thing
      to do when charges are made
      against you is to either ignore
      them or to deny them without
      giving details. I believe we've
      had enough of that in the
      United States, particularly with
      the present Administration in
      Washington, D.C. To me the
      office of the Vice Presidency
      of the United States is a great
      office, and I feel that the
      people have got to have
      confidence in the integrity
      of the men who run for that
      office and who might obtain it.

      [SINGLESPACING]

      Over a century ago Washington
      laid the corner stone of the
      Capitol in what was then
      little more than a tract of
      wooded wilderness here beside
      the Potomac. We now find it
      necessary to provide by great
      additional buildings for the
      business of the government.
