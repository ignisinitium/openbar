  It works!

  Your **docassemble** server is working.  Congratulations!

  % if get_config('default interview') == 'docassemble.base:data/questions/default-interview.yml':
  You are seeing this screen because your [Configuration] contains the
  following directive:

  `default interview: docassemble.base:data/questions/default-interview.yml`

  Once you create an interview of your own, you will want to change
  the `default interview` so that your end users will not see this
  screen when they go to your site.  (There are also other ways to
  configure what users see when they visit your site.)
  % elif get_config('default interview') is None:
  You are seeing this screen because your [Configuration] does not
  contain a `default interview` directive.  This interview,
  `docassemble.base:data/questions/default-interview.yml`, is a
  "factory default" interview.

  Once you create an interview of your own, you will want to add a
  `default interview` directive so that your end users will not see
  this screen when they go to your site.  (There are also other ways
  to configure what users see when they visit your site.)
